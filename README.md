EasyTrip

A simple app to help tourists. The most common problem faced by tourists is not knowing the place well.Most often they are given inaccurate directions, tricked into paying more money for travel.Besides the problem of making decisions as to where to go next is always present. Our app seeks to find a solution to this.We made use of the google maps api and use of gps to track the user's location.Based on this, the user will be given real time suggestions on tourist destinations around him,Restaurants around him and also lodges. This app has a feature called travel guide which makes use of the weather data, information about opening and closing time of the place to be visited, the distance of the place from current location etc to give an almost accurate suggestion on where to go next to manage the time efficiently. What components have been used? • We used the Google Maps API to render the map of the given location specified by the coordinates of the point.The MapsAPI automatically handles access to GoogleMapsservers, data downloading,mapdisplay, and response to mapgestures. • We also used the GPS sensor in the phone to get user coordinates to then plot on the map. • We also made use of basic concepts like intents, fragments, error handling etc.
